# Orientalism in Australian Newspaper Fiction (1850â€“1949)

This project uses a multi-method digital humanities approach to analyse Orientalist discourse in Australian newspaper fiction from 1850 to 1949. The study combines BERT-based text classification, VADER sentiment analysis, and close reading to identify both explicit and latent Orientalist representations across time.
